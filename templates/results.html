                Hi! This is my summer project and it involved me learning 
                machine learning for something useful and meaningful.
            </p>
            <p>
                This
                website uses a model I trained to detect if an Xray shows
                Bacterial, Viral or no signs of Pneumonia. While Pneumonia
                may 
                not be prevalent in many ways it is relavant to me and 
                many others in the world.
            </p>

        <div class="row">
            <form class="col-sm" action="/test" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
                <input type="file" name="file"/>
                <input type="submit"/>
            </form>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <p>
                    To see if an Xray has anything please upload the image.
                    Please make sure it is an image file, jpeg or jpg to be exact.
                    Furthermore, this can only take in one image at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you find this useful and would like a better way to 
                    upload many images at a time, do contact me with the
                    contact information I provide in the about page.
